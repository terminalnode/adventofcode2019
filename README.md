# Advent of Code 2019
Here are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/). I plan to do these in Java primarily, but I may do solutions for some days in other languages as well. Java solutions are stored in folders with the number of the day, e.g. the folder `01` contains the Java solution for day 1. Other languages are stored in folders with the number of the day and the language, e.g. `01-python` for the Python solution to day 1.
